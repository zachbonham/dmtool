## Why

The GM Campaign Preference Tool requires a solid foundation to deliver its value proposition: helping tabletop RPG GMs align player expectations before session zero through structured surveys and archetype-based recommendations. Without proper project setup, development cannot begin, and the tool's ability to prevent campaign misalignment remains unrealized.

## What Changes

- Initialize a new Nuxt.js project with TypeScript support
- Configure Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up Supabase integration for data persistence
- Establish basic project structure with pages, components, and utilities
- Configure development environment and build tools

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `project-structure`: Basic Nuxt.js application structure with routing, components, and utilities
- `database-schema`: Supabase database setup for storing surveys, responses, and recommendations
- `survey-interface`: User interface for creating and completing player preference surveys
- `archetype-scoring`: Logic to evaluate survey responses against four campaign archetypes
- `recommendation-engine`: Algorithm to generate actionable campaign theme and tone recommendations

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- No existing capabilities are being modified in this initial setup -->

## Impact

- New project files and directory structure
- Dependencies on Nuxt.js 3, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase client libraries
- Development environment configuration
- Build and deployment pipeline setup

# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform
context: |
  Tech stack: Nuxt.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
  Deployment: Supabase
  Domain: TTRPG campaign survey tool
  Tabletop RPG campaigns fail — not because the GM is unprepared, but because the table is misaligned. Players show up expecting wildly different things: one wants brutal combat, another wants deep character drama, a third wants an open sandbox. Without a structured way to surface these preferences before session zero, GMs are flying blind.

  The GM Campaign Preference Tool solves this by giving GMs a short, structured player survey that collects preferences, scores them against four campaign archetypes, and produces an actionable recommendation for campaign theme and tone — before a single die is rolled.


# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
